Since my code base got very, very messy in C#. I have to put some time into thinking about how this will be organzied.
Do I split each application into folders and classes within it? Sounds dumb
Do I desgin each helper function as a class and build the driver as a individual app or one big driver?
Or not think at all and start writing code until I see the problem. Likely.
